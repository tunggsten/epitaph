## Coding Standards
- Use `PascalCase` for class, method, property and struct names.
- Use `camelCase` for class fields.
- Favor properties over raw fields, and put appropriate methods in getters and setters.
- Use one file per class, unless a class is only used to facilitate another class.
- Add reference to classes with all methods and attributes into the Obsidian Vault.
